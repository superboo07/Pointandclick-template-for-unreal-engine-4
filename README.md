# Point and click template

This is a simple little template for those who want to make a point and click adventure game in UE4. Documentation is included in the form of tutorials, in order to access these all you have to do it go to the tutorial menu inside of UE4, and select the first catagory.

Please do note that not all assets here are mine, any files contained inside of the starter content folder are property of Epic games and are used purely for demonstration purposes (I recommend you replace the meshes with your own).
